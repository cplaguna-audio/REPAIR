    REPAIR is a web app for repairing and enhancing low quality audio files. Our inspiration 
    comes from the large number of low quality concert recordings on YouTube. We would like to
    enjoy these recordings, but too often, the audio is simply unlistenable! This is often
    the fault of poor quality microphones in mobile phones. It is our hope that post-processing
    these audio files can improve the listening experience. Think of REPAIR as an audio equivalent to Instagram
    filters or video stabilization. Use our free audio processing modules to reduce clipping,
    remove noise, and filter your audio. Then, compare the enhanced audio to the original, 
    and when satisfied, download the result to your computer.<p>
    Steps<p>
    1. Upload an audio file. (Note that REPAIR is entirely client-side, so we will not be storing the audio anywhere besides your computer)<p>
    2. Click the Declip button, the Noise Removal button, or Auto EQ button to open the option panel for that module. <p>
    3. Modify the parameters (see below) specific to the module. <p>
    4. Click "Activate" to enable the module. Active modules are shown in green, and inactive modules are shown in red. <p>
    5. Click "Preview" to hear an exerpt of the repaired audio. All active modules will be processed before previewing. <p>
    6. After activating all desired modules, click "Repair" to process the audio. This may take a few minutes, depending on the length of the file. <p>
    7. Play the audio in our audio player and toggle between the original and the processed audio to compare the files. <p>
    8. Click "Download" to download the processed audio to your computer.<p>
